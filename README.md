# dqtranslator
The dqtranslator component maps (domain) RQA definitions to technical RQA configurations that can be executed by dqexec. It also maps the technical results (metrics) back to the domain level, i.e., domain experts can understand the results.

A more detailed description of this component's architecture is provided in the [arc42 document](https://dqualizer.github.io/dqualizer).
